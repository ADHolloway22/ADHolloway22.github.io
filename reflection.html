  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <h2>My Goals and Web Development Journey</h2>

  <p class="first-paragraph">One of my biggest dreams is to play professional basketball overseas. I've dedicated countless hours to training, studying the game, and improving both physically and mentally. I believe that with continued discipline and focus, I can turn this dream into reality. But I also understand the importance of having skills beyond sports, which is why I’ve started building my knowledge in areas like web development.</p>

  <p class="indented">This course has introduced me to the basics of HTML, CSS, and website structure. Before this, I never imagined I’d be able to create a functional website from scratch. Learning how to format text, add images, create links, and build navigation bars has been both fun and rewarding. It's helped me see that coding isn’t as intimidating as it once seemed, and that it’s actually a valuable skill I can use in the future.</p>

  <p class="indented">I’ve especially enjoyed experimenting with styling through CSS. Changing fonts, colors, and layout has allowed me to express a different type of creativity. I liked seeing how small tweaks in code could totally change the look and feel of a page. Using pseudo-elements like `::first-letter` and working with the box model gave me a better understanding of how design works behind the scenes.</p>

  <p class="indented">While basketball remains my primary focus, I now see web development as a skill I can use alongside my athletic career — whether it’s building a personal brand, creating content, or even starting my own business one day. This course has been a great starting point, and I’m looking forward to learning more about how to make websites interactive and mobile-friendly.</p>
